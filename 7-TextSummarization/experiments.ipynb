Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders.

Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \\nAfrica.

During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B.

Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

He emphasizes the importance of youth and their aspirations, calling for accelerated development in the country.  Kalam recounts the question posed by a young girl, Anukriti, who wondered why India couldn't become developed before 2020, illustrating his commitment to empowering youth and their dreams for the nation's future.

       "'In his departing speech, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expresses gratitude for the past five years as President, highlighting the enriching interactions he\\'s had with people from diverse backgrounds. He emphasizes the importance of youth and their aspirations, calling for accelerated development in the country.  \\n\\nKalam recounts the question posed by a young girl, Anukriti, who wondered why India couldn\\'t become developed before 2020, illustrating his commitment to empowering youth and their dreams for the nation\\'s future.  He notes that Anukriti\\'s question reflects a widespread desire among India\\'s 540 million youth to live in a developed nation.\\n\\nHe shares several key messages, drawing inspiration from the life of Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a talented musician who overcame physical challenges through his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by his parents, teachers, academics and fans.  His performance at Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2007 is a testament to his dedication and the power of individual potential.  This encounter reinforces Kalam\\'s belief in the power of individual potential and the importance of nurturing talent. \\n\\nKalam stresses the need to empower villages, evidenced by his visit to a prosperous village in Nagaland where he saw successful fruit and vegetable production. He recognizes the importance of agriculture, emphasizing the need to double agricultural production while conserving resources and improving the economic conditions of farmers.  He believes in empowering farmers and nurturing fertile land for a second green revolution, noting the potential for a 4% annual increase in agricultural GDP growth through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.  He also recognizes the importance of infrastructure, particularly connectivity, pointing out that better roads are needed to facilitate the movement of goods from villages to markets. \\n\\nHis vision for empowered villages is further elaborated through the \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA) initiative, inspired by his meeting with villagers in Urusa who, after facing devastation due to an earthquake, demonstrated remarkable resilience in rebuilding their lives.  PURA aims to connect 65 villages with essential services and infrastructure, including healthcare centers, primary to post-graduate education, and vocational training centers, leading to economic connectivity.  He cites the successful example of Periyar PURA complex in Thanjavur district, where villagers, with support from experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), have developed internationally competitive prototypes for various products.  This initiative, led by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, exemplifies Kalam\\'s belief in leveraging rural resources and empowering communities for national development.  Villagers are engaged in cultivation, power generation using biomass, food processing, and running marketing centers, leading to sustainable economic development. \\n\\nHighlighting the importance of connectivity for societal transformation, Kalam mentions his proposal for a Pan African e-Network during his address to the Pan African Parliament in September 2004. This project aims to connect 53 African countries through a seamless integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless communication. He further describes the initiative\\'s impact, enabling one-hour live tele-consultations between doctors in Hyderabad and Addis Ababa, and facilitating instant communication between Heads of State across the 53 African nations. \\n\\nAlongside his vision for national development, Kalam underscores India\\'s commitment to global development through initiatives like tele-medicine in Ethiopia and educational programs with Ethiopian universities. He also emphasizes the importance of courage and resilience, drawing inspiration from the Car Nicobar islanders who, after the devastating 2004 tsunami, embraced the orphaned children from their community as their own. He composed a poem titled \"Sea Waves\" which reflected the islanders\\' fortitude and their determination to overcome adversity. \\n\\nKalam also pays tribute to India\\'s Armed Forces, sharing his personal experiences visiting Kumar in Siachen Glacier, experiencing a submarine journey in INS Sindhurakshak, and flying in a Sukhoi-30 fighter, underscoring his pride in their dedication and resilience. He expresses his admiration for the work of the soldiers, sailors, and air warriors who tirelessly safeguard the nation. He also acknowledges the contributions of internal security forces in ensuring the safety and security of citizens.\\n\\nTo further inspire and mobilize the youth, Kalam describes his meeting with the Lead India 2020 Foundation, a group dedicated to transforming youth into enlightened citizens. He highlights the positive impact of their training programs on students in Andhra Pradesh, fostering self-discipline, love for family and teachers, and a sense of national duty. He shares the story of Padma, a student leader who successfully weaned her father away from smoking after attending a Lead India Training Camp. This story exemplifies the transformative power of the program.\\n\\nFinally, Kalam calls for a nation where:\\n\\n- Equitable distribution and adequate access to energy and quality water are ensured.\\n- Agriculture, industry, and services are harmoniously integrated. \\n- Quality education is accessible to all, regardless of background.\\n- India becomes a global hub for talent in academia, science, and investment.\\n- Universal access to quality healthcare is a reality.\\n- Governance is responsive, transparent, and free from corruption.\\n- Poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated.\\n-  India emerges as a prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy nation with sustainable growth.\\n\\nHe believes that with the nation\\'s rich heritage, resources, and most importantly, the energy of its youth, India has the potential to achieve this goal. \\n\\n\\n\\nKalam concludes by reiterating his lifelong mission to connect the hearts and minds of India\\'s people, embedding within them the self-confidence to achieve their aspirations for a developed India by 2020. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
