      "Summary: John Wick is an American media franchise created by Derek Kolstad. It centers on a neo-noir action thriller film series featuring titular character portrayed by Keanu Reeves. Wick is a legendary hitman who is reluctantly drawn back into the criminal underworld after retiring. The franchise began with the release of John Wick (2014), which was followed by three sequels: Chapter 2 (2017), Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019), and Chapter 4 (2023). Various spin-offs expanded the franchise: the prequel comic book series John Wick: The Book of Rules (2017–2019), the prequel television miniseries The Continental (2023), and the spinoff film Ballerina (2025), all incorporating elements of alternate history.\n",
      "The films have received critical acclaim, and have been considered one of the greatest action film series of all time. Some critics and publications consider the first film, as well as Chapter 4, as two of the greatest action films ever made. The films have earned a collective gross of more than $1 billion worldwide.\n",

      "Lorena, an Ecuadorian immigrant, alleged that her husband John, a bar bouncer and former U.S. Marine, had raped and abused her for years. John was charged with rape later that year but was acquitted and subsequently starred in two pornographic films. The next year, Lorena was acquitted of assault by reason of insanity and went on to start a foundation for domestic abuse victims and their children. The couple divorced in 1995.\n",
